                    After procrastinating making a blog for more than a year, I finally forced myself to get one up and running and post atleast something today. If you check the code of this site, you'd find that some css units use variables while others don't. There is not rationale behind them. I just wanted to get something out and break the cycle of planning, procrastination and abandonment. Now that this post is sure to be posted on my "blog", I can finally let go.

                    This site is more of an experimental thing so the code is going to be very messy at best and reek of a beginner. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, just a vague list of things I want to add to this site. 
                    <pre>
- a "projects" page
- an experimental page for all the tiny webapps I want to develop
- a gallery of photos and videos
- a bullet journal
- etc
                    </pre>
                </p>
            </section> 
        </main> 

    </div>
